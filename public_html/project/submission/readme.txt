How to run site: Use the homepage_link.html file to get a direct link to the website or go to: http://fall2020-comp307.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs307-group14/project/html/index.php

The Admin login is located at Learn More->Admin Login (once on the Admin Login page, scroll down). To sign in as admin, type in "user1" as the username and "pass123" as the password. This redirects you to a page with multiple forms to edit the content on the home page (events, news and postings). These changes get saved to the SQL database.
